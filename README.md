# trait-behavioral-ungulates

## How does ecology predict ungulate traits? 
Hooved mammals vary in behavioural and life history traits that have affected their capacity for domestication. In turn, these traits are shaped by their environment, e.g. how some environments support many predators, such that their pressure drives prey behaviour. In this project we will test hypotheses about these interactions.
