We choose Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to analyze the relationship between ungulate traits
and ecology variables. According to the result of VIF analysis, columns from "Predictor" are
used as independent variables. Take one column from "ungulatesTraits" at a time as the
dependent variable. For the model selection the phylolm package and phyloglmstep function are required.
